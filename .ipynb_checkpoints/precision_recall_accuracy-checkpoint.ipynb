    "Now that we've started discussing classification, it's time to examine comparing our models to each other and choosing models of best fit. Previously in regression, we've been predicting values so it made sense to discuss error as a distance of how far off our estimates were. In classifying a binary variable however, we are either correct or incorrect. As a result, we tend to deconstruct this as how many false positives versus false negatives we come across.  \n",

    "At times, we may wish to tune a classification algorithm to optimize against precison or recall rather then overall accuracy. For example, imagine the scenario of predicting whether or not a patient is at risk for cancer and should be brought in for additional testing. In cases such as this, we often may want to cast a slightly wider net, and it is much preferable to optimize for precision, the number of cancer positive cases, then it is to optimize recall, the percentage of our predicted cancer-risk patients who are indeed positive."
